  description: "I completed these two projects for my Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship. These are both permanent gallery installations, essentially mini-exhibitions drawing on the museum's permanent collection that were featured in the Asian Art department's dedicated gallery spaces. These two projects were a highlight of my career so far; I loved every aspect of curating these installations, from the initial research, to writing the object labels, to designing the layout. It was all so exciting and fun.  <br><br>Pictured Above: Nakashima Harumi, <i>Work-0808,</i> 2008
