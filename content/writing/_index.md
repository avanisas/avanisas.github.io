    description: "Here is a selection of my academic and commercial art writing! In addition to these larger, public-facing writing projects, I have also written a lot of internal research documents and shorter public-facing pieces (like object labels) in my career. In my free time, I enjoy creative writing as well. Writing is a lifelong passion of mine and always central to my work. I love how art criticism requires a writer to engage with creativity, research, and analysis in one piece. <br><br>Pictured Above: Mahtab Hussain, <i>Friends, curry sauce and chips,</i> from the series <i>You Get Me?</i> (2007-2017)"
