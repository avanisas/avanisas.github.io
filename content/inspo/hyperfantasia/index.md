excerpt: I saw Hyperfantasia at the Brick Theater in Brooklyn in June 2022, a hypnotic drag cabaret unlike anything else I have seen. Tiresias' performance is a wonderfully abstract meditation on creation and being, essentially using the lessons of evolution and the example of the peacock (and other animals that have evolved to be beautiful) to present the necessity of beauty to survival. The show is a celebration of artistic experimentation and excess, one of my favorite examples of how science fiction and art can intersect and enrich each other.
