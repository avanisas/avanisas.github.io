excerpt: Chitra Ganesh's print series <i>Sultana's Dream</i> loosely illustrates Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain's 1905 story of the same name. The original story imagines a world run by women who have invented solar power, hydrpower, and ensured equality, while men are kept indoors and subjected to the conditions of <i>purdah.</i> Ganesh's interpretation of the story draws on an exuberant mix of South Asian artistic traditions, Afrofuturism, and her characteristically whimsical art style. This series is a true favorite that continuously inspires me, and I was so excited to see it featured in The Whitney's recent exhibition <i>Inheritance.</i>
