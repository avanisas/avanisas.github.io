excerpt: <i>Surrealism Beyond Borders</i> was an exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art featuring surrealist and surrealist-inspired art movements from around the world. The exhibition eschews a typical chronological format, instead allowing visitors to wander between different cultural and political moments, often including juxtapositions between different artworks from around the world. I often struggle with blockbuster exhibitions because I find the scale overwhelming, but I found that the breadth and scope of <i>Surrealism Beyond Borders</i> to be successful and exciting, rather than exhausting. The curators did an excellent job in drawing out the inherently political nature of Surrealism in a variety of cultural contexts. Sometimes, shows that look at modern art movements in non-Western contexts relegate non-Western artists to imitators or define their artistic production in terms of the West, so I appreciated how the exhibition granted artists from across different cultures the same agency, and actively worked against the "center-periphery" model that characterizes older art history.
