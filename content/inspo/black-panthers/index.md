excerpt: While I have enjoyed every exhibit I have seen at Poster House, <i>Black Power to Black People</i> stands out for its striking imagery, explicit politics, and clever integration of poster aesthetics into the installation design. I also loved the use of music in the gallery (with printed lyrics available) and the newspaper available to take home, including more in-depth information about women and the Black Panther party. I wish that the exhibit could have acknowledged how the BPP's effective imagery and dissemination of information had a global impact, but overall I found the exhibition informative and impactful.
