  About Me
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an Austin native currently completing my M.A. in Art History at UT Austin. Previously, I was a Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellow in the Asian Art department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, a Research and Interpretation Intern at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a Graduate Trainee at Christie's, where I held positions in the Client Services, South Asian Art, and Modern & Impressionist departments. 

My research focuses on modern and contemporary South Asian art, with an emphasis on how artists represent and navigate political and religious identities. I am also interested in photography, photobooks/artists books, and diasporic art.
